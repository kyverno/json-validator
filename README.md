# Kyverno JSON Validator

This repo is for an **experimental only** demo application which shows how Kyverno can be used to validate non-Kubernetes resources (i.e., generic JSON). It only aims to do two things: provide a basic UI for the purposes of testing and demonstrate how users who really want this capability today might do so by viewing some code.
